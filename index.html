        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>With a robust background in circuit development, software development, and product prototyping, I have cultivated a strong passion for innovative technologies and a solid foundation in electronic engineering. My current research, "Low-Cost Autonomous Rover with Heterogeneous Compute," has further refined my skills and deepened my understanding of the field.</p>
    
        <p>I am particularly intrigued by the potential to develop a theoretical framework for emerging learning algorithms that amalgamate the strengths of local brain-inspired learning and backpropagation. This interest is complemented by my ongoing project, where I am building an event-driven asynchronous spiking neural network framework based on the Rust language.</p>
    
        <p>This project involves testing the effects of adding complexity to neural structures, such as dendrite delay, dendrite attenuation, dendrite grouping and cross talk, axon distance searching distributions, and the use of neuromodulators similar to dopamine and serotonin to modulate the adaptive nature of the parameters in search of optimized neural circuits. This work has further fueled my interest in the PhD position you are offering.</p>
