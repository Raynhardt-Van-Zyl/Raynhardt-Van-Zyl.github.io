                <p class="card-text">This study presents a novel approach to the design of cost-effective autonomous rovers using a heterogeneous computing architecture. The research focuses on the development and evaluation of an autonomous rover system, priced under R50 000, that can operate independently in various environments. The system's performance was assessed in real-world conditions, demonstrating an average speed of 0.5 m/s, an energy consumption of 0.2 kWh, and a decision-making error rate below 5%. The results suggest that the use of heterogeneous computing architectures can lead to the development of affordable and efficient autonomous navigation systems. The paper concludes by discussing potential future research directions and the broader implications of these findings for the field of autonomous systems.</p>

                <p class="card-text">This project aims to develop an asynchronous impulse-based spiking neural network (SNN) framework using the Rust programming language. SNNs are third-generation neural networks that mimic the behavior of neurons in the human brain. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks, SNNs communicate by means of spikes, which are discrete events that take place at points in time, making them highly efficient for certain types of computation.</p>
                <p class="card-text">The Rust programming language is chosen for its performance and memory safety, especially its emphasis on concurrency, which is a key aspect of SNNs. The goal is to create a framework that can handle large-scale, real-time simulations of SNNs, with an emphasis on performance and accuracy.</p>
                <p class="card-text">The project will involve designing and implementing the SNN model, developing efficient algorithms for spike propagation and synaptic weight adjustment, and creating a user-friendly API for defining and training SNNs. The project will also explore the use of GPU acceleration to further enhance the performance of the SNN simulations.</p>

                <p class="card-text">
                    The system employs advanced sensor technology and control algorithms to dynamically adjust the orientation of the solar panels, ensuring they remain perpendicular to the sun's rays at all times. This maximizes the incident solar radiation on the panels, thereby enhancing the overall energy output.
